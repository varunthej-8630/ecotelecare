Ecotelecare: 
Reinventing Rural Healthcare with Solar-Powered Telemedicine

Created by: S. Reyana, A. Divya Sree, K. Sneha Sri  
Stage: Conceptual Prototype | Ready for Pilot Deployment


Vision

Ecotelecare is Indiaâ€™s first fully solar-powered mobile telemedicine unit, designed to deliver essential healthcare services to rural and disaster-prone regions. Our mission is to eliminate healthcare deserts by bringing diagnostics, consultations, and preventive care directly to the doorstep â€” sustainably, affordably, and reliably.



Why This Matters

- 3.5+ billion people globally lack access to basic healthcare  
- Rural India faces chronic shortages in medical infrastructure  
- Power outages and climate disruptions cripple service delivery  
- Long travel times and high costs delay critical care  

Ecotelecare solves this with a mobile, off-grid, tech-enabled solution.


What Weâ€™ve Built

A modular, solar-powered van equipped with:

- Basic diagnostic tools (BP, glucose, pulse oximeter, etc.)  
- Telemedicine platform for remote consultations  
- IoT-enabled vitals monitoring  
- Cloud-based health records  
- Satellite/4G connectivity for uninterrupted service  
- HIPAA-compliant data encryption and secure APIs
